Heya! I'm carrot! I make games, and I'm  extremly stupid sometimes, so usually somethings end up taking longer than I expect them to, (Like this Readme that took over 5 months to get around to doing.) If you are expecting something from me that I said "It'll only take a couple of minutes!" It's gonna take the next 2 decades of my life.

Also semi-important I use HaxeFlixel for games.
