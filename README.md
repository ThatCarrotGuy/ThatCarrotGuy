Heya! I'm carrot! I make games. I'm a very heavy procrastinator, and I end up taking way too long to create said games. (Like this Readme that took over 5 months to get around to doing.) If you are expecting something from me that I said "It'll only take a couple of minutes!" It's gonna take the next 2 years.

Also semi-important I use GameMaker for games.
