I'm carrot, I make games, I am extremly un-smartness, so usually somethings end up taking longer than I expect them to, (Like this Readme that took over 5 months to get around to doing.) so yeah if you are expecting an update for something within a month, get ready to wait at least 8 more months, as I am currently busy doing nothing.
